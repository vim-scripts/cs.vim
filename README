Another C# syntax colorizer, this one made by a friend and I over the course of Beta 2. Some things don't work correctly, or aren't done yet (#region folding, stuff like that), but it's fairly generic enough to have a nice base for adding things.

To add:
- error classes
- directionals (and call them that)
- operators
- #region folding

I'll copy the contents of the System classes and integrate coloring for that (probably by copying wholesale from vimscript #116) if someone really wants me to do so. Ain't Open Source great? =P
